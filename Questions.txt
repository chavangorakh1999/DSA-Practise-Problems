Q.Sequence1

You are given two positive integers N and K, where K≤N. Find a sequence A1,A2,…,AN such that:

for each valid i, Ai is either i or −i
there are exactly K values of i such that 1≤i≤N and A1+A2+…+Ai>0
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them. It can be proved that at least one solution always exists.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.

Q.pairPositions

You are given two positive integers A and B. Find the number of pairs of positive integers (X,Y) such that 1≤X≤A, 1≤Y≤B and X+Y is even.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of valid pairs.
